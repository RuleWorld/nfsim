#+TITLE: =NFsim= â€“ the network free stochastic simulator

This version is forked from https://github.com/msneddon/nfsim, and it compiles using the GNU GCC compiler, v4.8.5 on an Ubuntu 64-bit machine.
You can check your version of GCC by:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gcc -v
#+END_SRC

To install, clone this repository to your =~/git= repo:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
git clone https://github.com/rasilab/nfsim.git
#+END_SRC

Then compile by:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
cd ~/git/nfsim
make
#+END_SRC

Once it is compiled, add the binary =NFsim= in the [[bin]] directory to your =PATH=.
For example, I add the following to my =~/.bashrc= script:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
export PATH=$PATH":/home/rasi/git/nfsim/bin"
#+END_SRC
